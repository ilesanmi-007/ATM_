# ATM_





This is a fully written pyhton code to mimick that of our regular Automated Teller MAchine (ATM)

It could generate account number for a person without an account number in the bank.
This is done by import random

It asks basic details such as email, first name, last name and password. (It even confirms if password are same)

All this datas are stored into a dictionary called datas
All datas are unique by the account number.
This means that the key of this dictionary is the unique account number of the acccount owner


BASIC OPERATIONS

-it could withdraw,
-it could deposit,
-it could transfer to whether same bank or another bank.... I made another dictionary to transfer to
-It checks if your balance is high enough for the amount you intend transferring
If not, it notifies you

-You could check your account balance



The code is open for upggrade. 
Watch out!
Thanks.
